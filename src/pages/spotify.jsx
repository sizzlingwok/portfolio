                <b>Takeaways:</b>
                <br />
                The inspiration for Spotify Party came from encountering a
                limitation with the group session feature in the Spotify app.
                This project allowed me to explore innovative design ideas while
                adhering to guidelines, deepening my understanding of app
                organization.

            text2={
              <>
                <br />
                Prototyping was challenging yet rewarding, refining my skills in
                smart animate techniques and maintaining visual continuity
                across platforms. Spotify Party marked my initial venture into
                designing a responsive design for both the desktop and mobile
                platform.

                <b>Things I would do differently:</b>
                <br />
                In hindsight, I devoted considerable time to manual tasks like
                copying album cover arts and track information, which prolonged
                the design phase.

              <>
                <br />
                Reflecting on this, I realize I could have streamlined the
                process by reusing assets and focusing more on functional
                aspects to expedite project completion.
